<h1>The Parable of the Faithful Servant</h1>
<p class="bs-grey">(Mt. 24:45-51)</p>
<div class="bs-container">
<p>42 Watch therefore, for you don’t know in what hour your Lord comes. 43 But know this, that if the master of the house had known in what watch of the night the thief was coming, he would have watched, and would not have allowed his house to be broken into. 44 Therefore also be ready, for in an hour that you don’t expect, the Son of Man will come.</p>
<p>45 “Who then is the faithful and wise servant, whom his lord has set over his household, to give them their food in due season?</p>
<p>46 Blessed is that servant whom his lord finds doing so when he comes.</p>
<p class="bs-quote">47 Most certainly I tell you that he will set him over all that he has.</p>
<p>48 But if that evil servant should say in his heart, ‘My lord is delaying his coming,’ 49 and begins to beat his fellow servants, and eat and drink with the drunkards,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">50 the lord of that servant will come in a day when he doesn’t expect it and in an hour when he doesn’t know it, 51 and will cut him in pieces and appoint his portion with the hypocrites. That is where the weeping and grinding of teeth will be.</p>
<p>(Matthew 24:45-51)</p>
