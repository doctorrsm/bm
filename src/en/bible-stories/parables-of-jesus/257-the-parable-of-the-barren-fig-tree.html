<h1 style="text-align: center;">The Parable of the Barren Fig Tree</h1>
<p class="bs-grey">(Lk. 13:6-9)</p>
<div class="bs-container">
<p>6 He spoke this parable.</p>
<p>“A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard, and he came seeking fruit on it, and found none. 7 He said to the vine dresser,</p>
<p class="bs-quote">‘Behold, these three years I have come looking for fruit on this fig tree, and found none. Cut it down. Why does it waste the soil?’</p>
<p>8 He answered,</p>
<p class="bs-quote">‘Lord, leave it alone this year also, until I dig around it and fertilize it. 9 If it bears fruit, fine; but if not, after that, you can cut it down.’”</p>
<p>(Luke 13:6-9)</p>
