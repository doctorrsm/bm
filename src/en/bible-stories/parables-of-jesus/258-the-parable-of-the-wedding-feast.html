<h1 style="text-align: center;">The Parable of the Wedding Feast</h1>
<p class="bs-grey">(Mt 22:1-14)</p>
<div class="bs-container">
<p>1Jesus answered and spoke to them again in parables, saying,</p>
<p>2 “The Kingdom of Heaven is like a certain king, who made a wedding feast for his son, 3 and sent out his servants to call those who were invited to the wedding feast, but they would not come.</p>
<p>4 Again he sent out other servants, saying,</p>
<p class="bs-quote">‘Tell those who are invited, “Behold, I have prepared my dinner. My cattle and my fatlings are killed, and all things are ready. Come to the wedding feast!”’</p>
<p>5 But they made light of it, and went their ways, one to his own farm, another to his merchandise; 6 and the rest grabbed his servants, treated them shamefully, and killed them.</p>
<p>7 When the king heard that, he was angry, and sent his armies, destroyed those murderers, and burned their city. 8 “Then he said to his servants,</p>
<p class="bs-quote">‘The wedding is ready, but those who were invited weren’t worthy. 9 Go therefore to the intersections of the highways, and as many as you may find, invite to the wedding feast.’</p>
<p>10 Those servants went out into the highways and gathered together as many as they found, both bad and good. The wedding was filled with guests. 11 “But when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a man who didn’t have on wedding clothing, 12 and he said to him,</p>
<p class="bs-quote">‘Friend, how did you come in here not wearing wedding clothing?’</p>
<p>He was speechless. 13 Then the king said to the servants,</p>
<p class="bs-quote">‘Bind him hand and foot, take him away, and throw him into the outer darkness. That is where the weeping and grinding of teeth will be.’</p>
<p class="mainidea">14 For many are called, but few chosen.”</p>
<p>(Matthew 22:1-14)</p>
