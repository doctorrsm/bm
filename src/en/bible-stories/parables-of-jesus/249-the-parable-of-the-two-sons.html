<h1 style="text-align: center;">The Parable of the Two Sons</h1>
<p class="bs-grey">(Mt. 21:28-31)</p>
<div class="bs-container">
<p>28 ...A man had two sons, and he came to the first, and said,</p>
<p class="bs-quote">‘Son, go work today in my vineyard.’</p>
<p>29 He answered,</p>
<p class="bs-quote">‘I will not,’</p>
<p>but afterward he changed his mind, and went.</p>
<p>30 He came to the second, and said the same thing. He answered,</p>
<p class="bs-quote">‘I’m going, sir,’</p>
<p>but he didn’t go.</p>
<p class="bs-quote">31 Which of the two did the will of his father?”</p>
<p>They said to him,</p>
<p class="bs-quote">“The first.”</p>
<p>Jesus said to them,</p>
<p class="mainidea">“Most certainly I tell you that the tax collectors and the prostitutes are entering into God’s Kingdom before you.</p>
<p>(Matthew 21:28-31)</p>
