<h1 style="text-align: center;">The Parable of the Ten Virgins</h1>
<p class="bs-grey">(Mt. 25:1-13)</p>
<div class="bs-container">
<p>1 “Then the Kingdom of Heaven will be like ten virgins who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom. 2 Five of them were foolish, and five were wise.</p>
<p>3 Those who were foolish, when they took their lamps, took no oil with them, 4 but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps. 5 Now while the bridegroom delayed, they all slumbered and slept. 6 But at midnight there was a cry,</p>
<p class="bs-quote">‘Behold! The bridegroom is coming! Come out to meet him!’</p>
<p>7 Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps. 8 The foolish said to the wise,</p>
<p class="bs-quote">‘Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out.’</p>
<p>9 But the wise answered, saying,</p>
<p class="bs-quote">‘What if there isn’t enough for us and you? You go rather to those who sell, and buy for yourselves.’</p>
<p>10 While they went away to buy, the bridegroom came, and those who were ready went in with him to the wedding feast, and the door was shut. 11 Afterward the other virgins also came, saying,</p>
<p class="bs-quote">‘Lord, Lord, open to us.’</p>
<p>12 But he answered,</p>
<p class="bs-quote">‘Most certainly I tell you, I don’t know you.’</p>
<p><strong>13 Watch therefore, for you don’t know the day nor the hour in which the Son of Man is coming.</strong></p>
<p>(Matthew. 25:1-13)</p>
