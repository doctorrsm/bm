<h1 style="text-align: center;">The Parable of the Ten Minas</h1>
<p class="bs-grey">(Luke 19:11-27)</p>
<div class="bs-container">
<p>11 As they heard these things, he went on and told a parable, because he was near Jerusalem, and they supposed that God’s Kingdom would be revealed immediately. 12 He said therefore,</p>
<p>“A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom and to return. 13 He called ten servants of his and gave them ten mina coins, and told them,</p>
<p class="bs-quote">‘Conduct business until I come.’</p>
<p>14 But his citizens hated him, and sent an envoy after him, saying,</p>
<p class="bs-quote">‘We don’t want this man to reign over us.’</p>
<p>15 “When he had come back again, having received the kingdom, he commanded these servants, to whom he had given the money, to be called to him, that he might know what they had gained by conducting business.</p>
<p>16 The first came before him, saying,</p>
<p class="bs-quote">‘Lord, your mina has made ten more minas.’</p>
<p>17 “He said to him,</p>
<p class="bs-quote">‘Well done, you good servant! Because you were found faithful with very little, you shall have authority over ten cities.’</p>
<p>18 “The second came, saying,</p>
<p class="bs-quote">‘Your mina, Lord, has made five minas.’</p>
<p>19 “So he said to him,</p>
<p class="bs-quote">‘And you are to be over five cities.’</p>
<p>20 Another came, saying,</p>
<p class="bs-quote">‘Lord, behold, your mina, which I kept laid away in a handkerchief, 21 for I feared you, because you are an exacting man. You take up that which you didn’t lay down, and reap that which you didn’t sow.’</p>
<p>22 “He said to him,</p>
<p class="bs-quote">‘Out of your own mouth I will judge you, you wicked servant! You knew that I am an exacting man, taking up that which I didn’t lay down, and reaping that which I didn’t sow. 23 Then why didn’t you deposit my money in the bank, and at my coming, I might have earned interest on it?’</p>
<p>24 He said to those who stood by,</p>
<p class="bs-quote">‘Take the mina away from him and give it to him who has the ten minas.’</p>
<p>25 “They said to him,</p>
<p class="bs-quote">‘Lord, he has ten minas!’</p>
<p class="mainfact">26 ‘For I tell you that to everyone who has, will more be given; but from him who doesn’t have, even that which he has will be taken away from him.</p>
<p class="bs-quote">27 But bring those enemies of mine who didn’t want me to reign over them here, and kill them before me.’”</p>
<p>(Luke 19:11-27)</p>
