<p>5 He said to them,</p>
<p>“Which of you, if you go to a friend at midnight, and tell him,</p>
<p class="bs-quote">‘Friend, lend me three loaves of bread, 6 for a friend of mine has come to me from a journey, and I have nothing to set before him,’</p>
<p>7 and he from within will answer and say,</p>
<p class="bs-quote">‘Don’t bother me. The door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed. I can’t get up and give it to you’?</p>
<p>8 I tell you, although he will not rise and give it to him because he is his friend, yet because of his persistence, he will get up and give him as many as he needs.</p>
<p>(Luke 11:5-8)</p>
