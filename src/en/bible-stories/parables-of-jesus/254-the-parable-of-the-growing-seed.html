<p class="bs-grey">(Мк. 4:26-29)</p>

<p>26 He said,</p>
<p class="bs-quote">“God’s Kingdom is as if a man should cast seed on the earth, 27 and should sleep and rise night and day, and the seed should spring up and grow, though he doesn’t know how. 28 For the earth bears fruit by itself: first the blade, then the ear, then the full grain in the ear.</p>
<p class="bs-quote">29 But when the fruit is ripe, immediately he puts in the sickle, because the harvest has come.”</p>
<p>(Mark 4:26-29)</p>
