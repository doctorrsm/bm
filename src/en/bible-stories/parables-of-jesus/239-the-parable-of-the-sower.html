<h1 style="text-align: center;">The Parable of the Sower</h1>
<p class="bs-grey">(Mt. 13:3-23 и Mk. 4:3-8; Mk. 4:14-20; Lk. 8:5-8; Lk. 8:11-15)</p>

<p class="bs-container">3 He spoke to them many things in parables, saying, “Behold, a farmer went out to sow. 4 As he sowed,</p>
<ul>
<li class="bs-container">some seeds fell <strong>by the roadside</strong>, and the birds came and devoured them.</li>
<li class="bs-container">5 Others fell <strong>on rocky ground</strong>, where they didn’t have much soil, and immediately they sprang up, because they had no depth of earth. 6 When the sun had risen, they were scorched. Because they had no root, they withered away.</li>
<li class="bs-container">7 Others fell among <strong>thorns</strong>. The thorns grew up and choked them.</li>
<li class="bs-container">8 Others fell on <strong>good soil</strong> and yielded fruit: some one hundred times as much, some sixty, and some thirty.</li>
</ul>
<p class="bs-container bs-grey">...</p>
<p class="bs-container">“Hear, then, the parable of the farmer.</p>
<ul>
<li class="bs-container">19 When anyone hears the word of the Kingdom and doesn’t understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away that which has been sown in his heart. This is what was <strong>sown by the roadside</strong>.</li>
<li class="bs-container">20 What was sown <strong>on the rocky places</strong>, this is he who hears the word and immediately with joy receives it; 21 yet he has no root in himself, but endures for a while. When oppression or persecution arises because of the word, immediately he stumbles.</li>
<li class="bs-container">22 What was sown <strong>among the thorns</strong>, this is he who hears the word, but the cares of this age and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and he becomes unfruitful.</li>
<li class="bs-container">23 What was sown <strong>on the good ground</strong>, this is he who hears the word and understands it, who most certainly bears fruit and produces, some one hundred times as much, some sixty, and some thirty.”</li>
</ul>
