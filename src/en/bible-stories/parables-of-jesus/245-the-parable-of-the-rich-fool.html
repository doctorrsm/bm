<p>16 He spoke a parable to them, saying, “The ground of a certain rich man produced abundantly. 17 He reasoned within himself, saying,</p>
<p class="bs-container bs-quote">‘What will I do, because I don’t have room to store my crops?’</p>
<p>18 He said, ‘This is what I will do. I will pull down my barns, build bigger ones, and there I will store all my grain and my goods. 19 I will tell my soul,</p>
<p class="bs-quote">“Soul, you have many goods laid up for many years. Take your ease, eat, drink, and be merry.”’</p>
<p>20 “But God said to him,</p>
<p class="bs-quote">‘You foolish one, tonight your soul is required of you. The things which you have prepared—whose will they be?’</p>
<p>21 <strong>So is he who lays up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God.”</strong></p>
<p>(Luke 12:16-21)</p>
