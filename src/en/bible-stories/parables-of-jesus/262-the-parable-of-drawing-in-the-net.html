<h1 style="text-align: center;">The Parable of Drawing in the Net</h1>
<p class="bs-grey">(Mt. 13:47-50)</p>
<div class="bs-container">
<p>47 “Again, the Kingdom of Heaven is like a dragnet that was cast into the sea and gathered some fish of every kind, 48 which, when it was filled, fishermen drew up on the beach. They sat down and gathered the good into containers, but the bad they threw away.</p>
<p>49 <strong>So will it be in the end of the world. The angels will come and separate the wicked from among the righteous</strong>, 50 and will cast them into the furnace of fire. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.”</p>
<p>(Matthew 13:47-50)</p>
