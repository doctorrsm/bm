<h1 style="text-align: center;">The Parable of the Lost Coin</h1>
<p class="bs-grey">Luke 15:8-10</p>
<div class="bs-container">
<p>8 Or what woman, if she had ten drachma[a] coins, if she lost one drachma coin, wouldn’t light a lamp, sweep the house, and seek diligently until she found it? 9 When she has found it, she calls together her friends and neighbors, saying,</p>
<p class="bs-quote">‘Rejoice with me, for I have found the drachma which I had lost.’</p>
<p class="bs-quote"><strong>10 Even so, I tell you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner repenting.” </strong></p>
<p>(Luke 15:8-10)</p>
