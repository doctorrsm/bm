<h1 style="text-align: center;">The Parable of the Unjust Steward</h1>
<p class="bs-grey">(Lk. 16:1-9)</p>
<div class="bs-container">
<p>1 He also said to his disciples,</p>
<p>“There was a certain rich man who had a manager. An accusation was made to him that this man was wasting his possessions. 2 He called him, and said to him,</p>
<p class="bs-quote">‘What is this that I hear about you? Give an accounting of your management, for you can no longer be manager.’</p>
<p>3 “The manager said within himself,</p>
<p class="bs-quote">‘What will I do, seeing that my lord is taking away the management position from me? I don’t have strength to dig. I am ashamed to beg. 4 I know what I will do, so that when I am removed from management, they may receive me into their houses.’</p>
<p>5 Calling each one of his lord’s debtors to him, he said to the first,</p>
<p class="bs-quote">‘How much do you owe to my lord?’</p>
<p>6 He said,</p>
<p class="bs-quote">‘A hundred batos[a] of oil.’</p>
<p>He said to him,</p>
<p class="bs-quote">‘Take your bill, and sit down quickly and write fifty.’</p>
<p>7 Then he said to another,</p>
<p class="bs-quote">‘How much do you owe?’</p>
<p>He said,</p>
<p class="bs-quote">‘A hundred cors[b] of wheat.’</p>
<p>He said to him,</p>
<p class="bs-quote">‘Take your bill, and write eighty.’</p>
<p>8 “His lord commended the dishonest manager because he had done wisely, for the children of this world are, in their own generation, wiser than the children of the light.</p>
<p>9 I tell you,</p>
<p class="mainidea">make for yourselves friends by means of unrighteous mammon, so that when you fail, they may receive you into the eternal tents.</p>
<p>(Luke 16:1-9)</p>
