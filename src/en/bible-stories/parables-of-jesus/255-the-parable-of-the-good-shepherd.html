<h1 style="text-align: center;">The parable of the good shepherd</h1>
<p class="bs-grey">(Jn 10:1-16)</p>
<div class="bs-container">
<p>1 “Most certainly, I tell you,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">one who doesn’t enter by the door into the sheep fold, but climbs up some other way, is a thief and a robber.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">2 But one who enters in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep. 3 The gatekeeper opens the gate for him, and the sheep listen to his voice. He calls his own sheep by name, and leads them out.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">4 Whenever he brings out his own sheep, he goes before them, and the sheep follow him, for they know his voice.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px;">5 They will by no means follow a stranger, but will flee from him; for they don’t know the voice of strangers.”</p>
<p>6 Jesus spoke this parable to them, but they didn’t understand what he was telling them.</p>
<p>7 Jesus therefore said to them again,</p>
<p>“Most certainly, I tell you, I am the sheep’s door. 8 All who came before me are thieves and robbers, but the sheep didn’t listen to them. 9 I am the door. If anyone enters in by me, he will be saved, and will go in and go out, and will find pasture.</p>
<p>10 The thief only comes to steal, kill, and destroy.</p>
<p>I came that they may have life, and may have it abundantly. 11 I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.</p>
<p>12 He who is a hired hand, and not a shepherd, who doesn’t own the sheep, sees the wolf coming, leaves the sheep, and flees. The wolf snatches the sheep, and scatters them. 13 The hired hand flees because he is a hired hand, and doesn’t care for the sheep.</p>
<p>14 I am the good shepherd. I know my own, and I’m known by my own; 15 even as the Father knows me, and I know the Father. I lay down my life for the sheep. 16 I have other sheep, which are not of this fold.Isaiah 56:8 I must bring them also, and they will hear my voice. They will become one flock with one shepherd.</p>
<p>(John 10:1-16)</p>
