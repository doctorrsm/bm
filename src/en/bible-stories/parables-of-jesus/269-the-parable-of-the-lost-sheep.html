<p>3 He told them this parable.</p>
<p>4 “Which of you men, if you had one hundred sheep, and lost one of them, wouldn’t leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness, and go after the one that was lost, until he found it? 5 When he has found it, he carries it on his shoulders, rejoicing. 6 When he comes home, he calls together his friends and his neighbors, saying to them,</p>
<p class="bs-quote">‘Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep which was lost!’</p>
<p class="bs-quote"><strong>7 I tell you that even so there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents, than over ninety-nine righteous people who need no repentance. </strong></p>
<p>(Luke 15:3-7)</p>
