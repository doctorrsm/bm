<p>9 He also spoke this parable to certain people who were convinced of their own righteousness, and who despised all others.</p>
<p>10 “Two men went up into the temple to pray; one was a Pharisee, and the other was a tax collector. 11 The Pharisee stood and prayed to himself like this:</p>
<p class="bs-quote">‘God, I thank you that I am not like the rest of men, extortionists, unrighteous, adulterers, or even like this tax collector. 12 I fast twice a week. I give tithes of all that I get.’</p>
<p>13 But the tax collector, standing far away, wouldn’t even lift up his eyes to heaven, but beat his breast, saying,</p>
<p class="bs-quote">‘God, be merciful to me, a sinner!’</p>
<p>14 I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other;</p>
<p class="mainidea">for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but he who humbles himself will be exalted.”</p>
<p>Luke 18:9-14)</p>
