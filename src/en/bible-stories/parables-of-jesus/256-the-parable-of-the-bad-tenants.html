<h1 style="text-align: center;">The Parable of the Bad Tenants</h1>
<p>(Mt. 21:33-41; Mk. 12:1-9;; Lk. 20:9-16)</p>
<div class="bs-container">
<p>33 “Hear another parable.</p>
<p>There was a man who was a master of a household who planted a vineyard, set a hedge about it, dug a wine press in it, built a tower, leased it out to farmers, and went into another country.</p>
<p>34 When the season for the fruit came near, he sent his servants to the farmers to receive his fruit.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">35 The farmers took his servants, beat one, killed another, and stoned another.</p>
<p>36 Again, he sent other servants more than the first;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">and they treated them the same way.</p>
<p>37 But afterward he sent to them his son, saying,</p>
<p class="bs-quote">‘They will respect my son.’</p>
<p>38 But the farmers, when they saw the son, said among themselves,</p>
<p class="bs-quote" style="padding-left: 30px;">‘This is the heir. Come, let’s kill him and seize his inheritance.’</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">39 So they took him and threw him out of the vineyard, then killed him.</p>
<p>40 When therefore the lord of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those farmers?” 41 They told him,</p>
<p class="bs-quote">“He will miserably destroy those miserable men, and will lease out the vineyard to other farmers who will give him the fruit in its season.”</p>
<p>(Matthew 21:33-41)</p>
