<h1 style="text-align: center;">The Parable of the Unjust Judge</h1>
<p class="bs-grey">(Lk. 18:1-8)</p>
<div class="bs-container">
<p>1 He also spoke a parable to them that they must always pray, and not give up, 2 saying,</p>
<p>“There was a judge in a certain city who didn’t fear God, and didn’t respect man.</p>
<p>3 A widow was in that city, and she often came to him, saying,</p>
<p class="bs-quote">‘Defend me from my adversary!’</p>
<p>4 He wouldn’t for a while, but afterward he said to himself,</p>
<p class="bs-quote">‘Though I neither fear God, nor respect man, 5 yet because this widow bothers me, I will defend her, or else she will wear me out by her continual coming.’”</p>
<p>6 The Lord said,</p>
<p class="bs-quote">“Listen to what the unrighteous judge says.</p>
<p class="mainidea">7 Won’t God avenge his chosen ones who are crying out to him day and night, and yet he exercises patience with them?</p>
<p class="bs-quote">8 I tell you that he will avenge them quickly. Nevertheless, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on the earth?”</p>
<p>(Luke 18:1-8)</p>
