<h1 style="text-align: center;">The Parable of the Great Banquet</h1>
<p class="bs-grey">(Lk. 14:16-24)</p>
<div class="bs-container">
<p>16 But he said to him, “A certain man made a great supper, and he invited many people. 17 He sent out his servant at supper time to tell those who were invited,</p>
<p class="bs-quote">‘Come, for everything is ready now.’</p>
<p>18 They all as one began to make excuses.</p>
<p>“The first said to him,</p>
<p class="bs-quote">‘I have bought a field, and I must go and see it. Please have me excused.’</p>
<p>19 “Another said,</p>
<p class="bs-quote">‘I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I must go try them out. Please have me excused.’</p>
<p>20 “Another said,</p>
<p class="bs-quote">‘I have married a wife, and therefore I can’t come.’</p>
<p>21 “That servant came, and told his lord these things. Then the master of the house, being angry, said to his servant,</p>
<p class="bs-quote">‘Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in the poor, maimed, blind, and lame.’</p>
<p>22 “The servant said,</p>
<p class="bs-quote">‘Lord, it is done as you commanded, and there is still room.’</p>
<p>23 “The lord said to the servant,</p>
<p class="bs-quote">‘Go out into the highways and hedges, and compel them to come in, that my house may be filled. 24 For I tell you that none of those men who were invited will taste of my supper.’”</p>
<p>(Luke 14:16-24)</p>
