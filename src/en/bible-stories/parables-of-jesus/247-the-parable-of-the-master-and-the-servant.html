<h1 style="text-align: center;">The Parable of the Master and the Servant</h1>
<p class="bs-grey">(Lk. 17:7-10)</p>
<div class="bs-container">
<p>7 But who is there among you, having a servant plowing or keeping sheep, that will say when he comes in from the field,</p>
<p class="bs-quote">‘Come immediately and sit down at the table,’</p>
<p>8 and will not rather tell him,</p>
<p class="bs-quote">‘Prepare my supper, clothe yourself properly, and serve me, while I eat and drink. Afterward you shall eat and drink’?</p>
<p>9 Does he thank that servant because he did the things that were commanded? I think not.</p>
<p class="mainidea">10 Even so you also, when you have done all the things that are commanded you, say, ‘We are unworthy servants. We have done our duty.’</p>
<p>(Luke17:7-10)</p>
